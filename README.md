# Titanic Survival Prediction with TPOT, Flask, and LIME

This project is a machine learning pipeline for predicting Titanic survival using the Titanic dataset. It automates the model selection process with TPOT, deploys a Flask web application for user interaction, and uses LIME for explainability.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two main components:
1. A Titanic survival prediction model built with the [TPOT](https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/) AutoML library.
2. A Flask web application that allows users to enter Titanic passenger information and receive predictions on whether the passenger would have survived.

The model pipeline is saved and can be re-used to make predictions, while LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is used to generate an explanation for a prediction.

## Features

- **Automated Model Selection**: TPOT selects the best pipeline for classifying survival outcomes.
- **Flask Web Interface**: Users can input data for a Titanic passenger and receive predictions about their survival.
- **Model Explainability**: LIME is integrated to provide explanations for individual predictions.
